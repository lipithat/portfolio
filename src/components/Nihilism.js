                    Nihilism is something I think about a lot. I was first introduced to the 
                    concept through the show The Good Place (highly recommend btw). One of the 
                    main characters, Chidi Anagonye was a moral philosophy professor and he 
                    would spend much of his afterlife explaining various moral philosophies 
                    (surprise surprise).<br/><br/>

                        SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br/><br/>
                    </div>

                    There was this one particular moment of the show that stood out to me though. 
                    It was when Chidi had a mental breakdown after learning that everyone 
                    inevitably goes to the Bad Place after they die. As a result of this realization, 
                    Chidi goes insane and makes <a className="video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c-AawAKZ14">Peeps Chili</a>.
                    But more notably, he explains the meaning of life to his students.<br/><br/>
                    
                    In that scene, Chidi discusses the 3 main philosophies to leading an ethical life:
                    virtue ethics, consequentialism, and <i>nihilism</i>. But considering that nothing you
                    do actually matters and everyone goes straight to the Bad Place in the end, the most
                    intuitive ethical system to follow is nihilism. "The world is empty, there is no point
                    to anything and you're just going to die".<br/><br/>

                    So 15-year old me was incredibly intrigued by this monologue. It was during a period in my life
                    where I was experiencing religious confusion. That's a whole other can of worms, but in short, I was 
                    confused about which religion was correct and what to follow. Was there even an afterlife to look
                    forward to? If there was none, then why should I care about anything? What's the point of doing
                    anything or trying to make something of myself? Why do I bother working so hard? It sent me in a 
                    downward spiral and I questioned my existence, my purpose, and the 
                    meaning of life. Was it just to procreate, so I could subject my future children to an
                    existential crisis as well? It certainly seemed so.<br/><br/>

                    I called myself a nihilist for a long time. I didn't believe there was a point to my existence
                    or a reason to being a productive member of society. Friedrich Nietzsche's writings on nihilism
                    only reinforced this perspective. He described a world where traditional values had lost all power,
                    where people were no longer guided by a shared sense of purpose. Nietzche warned that this "death of God"
                    would create an existential crisis, where humanity would struggle to find direction in this 
                    indifferent universe. I resonated deeply with this idea, feeling utterly disconnected from societal
                    expectations and questioning the foundation of the world. I and everyone around me was drifting
                    through life without an anchor, burdened by the realization that nothing truly mattered.<br/><br/>

                    But contrary to popular belief, Nietzche was not actually a nihilist in the sense 
                    of advocating for a life devoid of meaning. In fact, he was deeply concerned about the dangers of
                    nihilism to society, and his philosophy was more so a form of existentialism. He recognized
                    the collapse of traditional values and how that could potentially create a belief that life is
                    meaningless. Nietzche's ultimate goal was to help society better itself, not succumb to this "death of God".

                    It wasn't until much later that I realized what true nihilism entails.
