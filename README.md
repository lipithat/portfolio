# Lipi's Portfolio Website 🌟

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm Lipi a passionate software developer with a keen interest in creating meaningful web applications. I also have an eye for aesthetics and hopefully you can see that through my portfolio, whiche showcases my projects and experiences.

## 🚀 About This Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The site is a platform to highlight my journey as a developer and the projects I've worked on.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React
- Node.js
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git/GitHub

## ✨ My Favorite Features
- <b>The Dynamic Background Animation:</b> the website features a moving stars background created using particles.js
- <b>The Theme:</b> Inspired by <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/"><em>Oh My Zsh</em></a>.

## 📈 Future Additions??
- <b>Additional Projects:</b> I plan on adding more projects showcasing my expertise. I'd also like to showcase my artwork.
- <b>Blog Section:</b> I've always wanted my own blog.
- <b>Light Mode Toggle</b> This is a huge maybe. I can't stand light mode and it wouldn't really work with the star particles.

## 📜 Getting Started
To get started with the project locally, clone the repository and run the following commands in your terminal:
