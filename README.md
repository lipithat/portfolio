# Lipi's Portfolio Website 🌟

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm Lipi a passionate software developer with a keen interest in creating meaningful web applications. I also have an eye for aesthetics and hopefully you can see that through my portfolio, whiche showcases my projects and experiences.

## 🚀 About This Project
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The site is a platform to highlight my journey as a developer and the projects I've worked on.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React
- Node.js
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git/GitHub

## ✨ My Favorite Features
- The Dynamic Background Animation: the website features a moving stars background created using particles.js
- The Theme: Inspired by <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/"><em>Oh My Zsh</em></a>.

## 📜 Getting Started
To get started with the project locally, clone the repository and run the following commands in your terminal:

###'npm install'


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
